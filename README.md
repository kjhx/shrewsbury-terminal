This is a profile (color scheme + some other options) for the macOS Terminal. It's based off of the system colors outlined in Apple's [Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/visual-design/color/). That said, it fits in well with the current macOS dark mode.
